AYB ChangeLog
=============

Version 2.06 (2011-12-01)
-------------------------

.Additions and changes

- Implement new lambda calculation and other minor changes to improve robustness.

- Implement improved quality scoring using similar algorithm to generalised phasing model.


Regression issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quality score related option mu (m) is replaced by a generalised error value (g). 


Version 2.05 (2011-10-18)
-------------------------

.Additions and changes

- Implement improved algorithm using generalised phasing model.


Regression issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Option P (Phasing) is replaced by A (Parameter A).
Options composition (c) and solver (S) are no longer available.

The fortran library dependency has been removed.


Version 2.04 (2011-07-22)
-------------------------

.Additions and changes

- Store intensities as integers to reduce memory use with little (if any) 
  difference to results as cif files are integer anyway.

- Changes to sim data output; lambda fit for each block; 
  lambda fit now uses logistic distribution and indicates with char (L); 
  runfile version number (5).


Regression issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This change follows the release of simNGS version 1.5 (12/05/11).


Version 2.03 (2011-05-10)
-------------------------

.Additions and changes

- Modelling refactored; no changes to functionality.

- Automated module and system testing introduced.


Version 2.02 (2011-02-17)
-------------------------

.Additions and changes

- Quality calibration table now contains values to use instead of conversion for default.
  Values used per run are output unless disabled with new 'noqualout' option.
  

Regression issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release has been coordinated with a new Recalibration tool that produces values to use. 
Ensure ayb_recal version is 08 Feb 2011 or later.


Version 2.01 (2011-01-21)
-------------------------

.Additions and changes

- New 'qualtab' option to read in a quality calibration table from a file and
  use to convert the default. Resultant values are output if log level is debug.

- New 'runfolder' option to read cif files directly from a run-folder.
  The command line 'prefix' is then replaced by a single lane tile or range. 

- A 'prefix' or input filepath may now contain a complete path.

.Bug fixes

- Large final processed values could cause an exception when output in cif format.

- Files were not closed during cif run-folder operations.


Version 2.00 (2010-12-07)
-------------------------

First AYB Version II public release.

Rewritten to be more robust and maintainable with a more flexible user-inteface.
